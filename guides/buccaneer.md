# Buccaneer Bounty

Buccaneer Bounty is a 7-day event focused on opening chests to earn Pearls of Enigma, which can be exchanged for exclusive city and march skins.

## How it Works
1.  **Collect Keys**: Complete tasks in the **Harbor Drill** (login, use speedups, defeat beasts, etc.) to get Corsair Keys.
2.  **Open Chests**: Use your Corsair Keys to open chests in the event shop.
3.  **Redeem**: Spend your **Pearls of Enigma** in the Emporium.

## Strategy

### Prioritize Splendid Chests
Always aim to open **Splendid (Gold/Red)** chests. They have the best Pearl drop rates.
*   You get 3 free daily refreshes for the chest board. Use them to hunt for Splendid chests. 
*   Avoid spending Corsair Keys on board refreshes, you can wait until the next day, or next event.
*  This is a good event to gain Widget Chests for F2P players.

### Light spender

If you are a light spender, you can get a lot of value from this event by purchasing the **Harbor Tome** as it doubles your daily rewards.
