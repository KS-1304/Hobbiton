# Merchant Empire Event

This event lasts for 7 days, you can dispatch caravans on the first 6 days. It typically runs alongside [Alliance Brawl](./brawl).

Each day you can dispatch 4 caravans, 2 at a time.  Each caravan takes 3.5 hours.

You should only dispatch SR or SSR caravans

It is best to do this during off-peak times.  Avoid immediately after reset.

In addition to dispatching caravans you can also raid other players Caravans.  Each caravan can be raided twice.

Try not to attack players who are much stronger than you (shown in red), as they will likely defeat your troops and you will lose out on points.

If your caravan is looted by other players, you can lose up to 50% of the loot.

In the initial events you will be matched with players from your own kingdom.  Later on you will be matched with players from other kingdoms.

If the event is running along side [Alliance Brawl](./brawl), try to focus attacks on players from the opposing alliance. Hiding caravans from our kingdom will help prevent friendly fire.
