# Cesares Fury

Cesares Fury is an alliance-coordinated event where you take down powerful captains for high-tier rewards.

## How to Play
1.  **Scout**: Use 15 stamina to find a captain on the map.
2.  **Attack**: Use a solo march (10 stamina) or a rally (25 stamina).
3.  **Difficulty**: Choose from Easy to Insane. Stick to the highest you can handle.

## Strategy

For most of the Cesares, defeating them in single combat is the most efficient use of stamina.  However, the Ceaares Accords (request help) feature is a good way to help your allies and earn extra rewards.

We recommend doing this on the 10th/20th/30th/40th Cesares, as these have bonus rewards.  From 40th onwards, use any Accords you have left, until you are out.

When you use an Accord, someone else from the alliance is asked to call a rally to defeat the Cesares. You may join this, but you do get rewards for defeating it regardless.

The player calling the rally also get's additional rewards, including an additional Accord.  This means that if a few players work together, you can affectivly trade Accords with each other, and get more rewards.


## The Boss Fight

In addition to the normal Cesares there are a few boss varients that R4 and R5's can summon.

For these, every player online should hit the boss at least once.  For low levels, this can mean sending a handful of troops, so you don't defeat it too quickly.

Once everyone online has hit the boss once, you can then send your full marches to defeat it.

You get the same reward for hitting it with a single troop, as you do for dealing half the damage.


## Additional Tips
*  Use the hero Diana.  Her skills reduce stamina costs.
