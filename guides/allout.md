# All Out (Kill Event)

The All Out event, also known as the Kill Event (KE), is a 2 day event where you earn points by defeating enemy troops. It often coincides with the final phases of [Strongest Governor (HOG)](./hog).

## Scoring System
Points are awarded based on the level of the troops you defeat:
*   **T10**: 13 points
*   **T9**: 11 points
*   **T8**: 9 points    
*   **T7**: 7 points
*   **T6**: 5 points
*   **T5**: 4 points
*   **T4**: 3 point
*   **T3**: 2 points
*   **T2**: 1 point
*   **T1**: 1 point

## Strategy

During all out you are encouraged to attack players.  Keep in mind that attacking players cities is one of the few ways to perminantly loose troops.  It is best to avoid hitting cities unless you are sure you won't loose a significant amount of troops.

### Safe Point Gaining
*   **Tile Hitting**: Attacking troops gathering at resource tiles is common and lower-risk than city-hitting. It usually only results in injuries, not deaths.
*   **Scout First**: Always scout your target to ensure their power level is within your range and to check for hidden reinforcements.

### Defense
For the most part amended NAP rules are in place during All Out, meaning the strongest players on the server will not be attacking cities. 

However if you have troops out gathering resources, these will still be attacked.

Check the updated NAP rules at the beginning of the event.
