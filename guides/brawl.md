# Alliance Brawl

The Alliance Brawl is a recurring competitive event where 2 alliances are matched up and compete for points. It will usually occur the week after [KvK](./kvk), and happen along side [Merchant Empire](./merchant). 

Typically, by the time Alliance Brawl is added to the game, your priority should be [KvK](./kvk). So generally you should not spend things like speedups, truegold, forgehammers, mithril, shards, widgets or taming marks if intend to use them for KvK.

## Preparation
* **Day Before**: Before reset, you can send out troops out gathering, to arrive after reset for a quick score boost.
* **Pet Skills**: The Bison's pet skill "Grip of the Titan", can be triggered, but not used.  This will cause the cooldown to start (even if it doesn't show it), this should allow you an additional activation, if timed correctly. Trigger this after sending out your gatherers.
* **Intel Missions**: You get points for handing in Intel Missions, but intel missions accumulate across 'refreshes'.  If you skip doing the intel missions before reset, you can complete an extra set at the beginning of scoring days (Day 2 & 4), for extra points.  You get the points at 'complete', not 'claim', so there is no there is no benefit to waiting to press 'claim all', in this event.

## Strategy

The best way to play Brawl is to maximize your "free" points:
* **[Merchant Empire](./merchant)**: Caravan raids, and Escort missions get you plenty of points every day. Raiding our competitor will help rob them of points.
* **Intel Missions**: Saving missions for **Day 2** and **Day 4** scoring days.
* **Gathering Resources**: **Day 1** and **Day 3** give points for gathering resources.
* **Hunting Beasts**: **Day 5** and **Day 6** give points for defeating beasts and calling rallies on terrors.
* **Other events**: If Armament Competition is also running, you might want to align goals, and use Hero shards on Day 2 of Brawl, and get points for both events.
* **Last day**: If you are close to a milestone, it might be worth using speedups or other resources to get the extra points.  Save these to the last day, and only use if needed.

## Spenders

This event rewards players for using Gems and obtaining Top-up points.  For people who know they are going to want to stock up on weekly cards, speed ups or consumables, one stratergy is to buy those now, when you will get additonal points when doing so.
This is a way to getting additional points, that won't rob you of resources you may want to use in future events.
