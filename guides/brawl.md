# Alliance Brawl

The Alliance Brawl is a recurring competitive event where 2 alliances are matched up and compete for points. It will usually occur the week after [KvK](./kvk), and happen along side [Merchant Empire](./merchant). 

Typically, by the time Alliance Brawl is added to the game, your priority should be [KvK](./kvk). So generally you should not spend things like speedups, truegold, forgehammers, mithril, shards, widgets or taming marks if intend to use them for KvK.

## Preparation
* **Day Before**: Before reset, you can send out troops out gathering, to arrive after reset for a quick score boost.
* **Pet Skills**: The Bison's pet skill "Grip of the Titan", can be triggered, but not used.  This will cause the cooldown to start (even if it doesn't show it), this should allow you an additional activation, if timed correctly. Trigger this after sending out your gatherers.
* **Intel Missions**: You get points for handing in Intel Missions, so you can complete missions the day before, and wait to hand them in until after reset on the scoring days (Day 2 & 4), for extra points.

## Summary

> **Legend:**  
> 🟢 **BEST:** Optimal time to perform task.  
> 🔵 **START:** Start this task the day before, so it completes on the BEST day.  
> 🔴 **DON'T:** Avoid performing task (save for the correct day).

## Strategy

The best way to play Brawl is to maximize your "free" points:
* **[Merchant Empire](./merchant)**: Truck raids, and Escort missions get you plenty of points every day. Raiding our competitor will help rob them of points.
* **Intel Missions**: Saving missions for **Day 2** and **Day 4** scoring days.
* **Gathering Resources**: **Day 1** and **Day 3** give points for gathering resources.
* **Hunting Beasts**: **Day 5** and **Day 6** give points for defeating beasts and calling rallies on terrors.
