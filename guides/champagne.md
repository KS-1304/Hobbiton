# Champagne Fair

The Champagne Fair is a monthly occurrence that allows you to trade in excess items for highly valuable upgrade materials.

## How it Works
1.  **Obtain Vouchers**: Exchange extra hero shards (from heroes already at 5 stars) and spare skill books for **Fair Vouchers**.
2.  **Redemption**: Spend your vouchers in the Fair shop.

## Priority Rewards
Vouchers do not expire, so save them for the rarest items:
1.  **Hero Widgets**: Your top priority for exclusive gear upgrades.
2.  **Forgehammers**: Essential for strengthening hero gear.
3.  **Governor Gear Materials**: Artisan's Visions and other high-end crafting materials.
4.  **Mithril**: Only if you are pushing gear past level 100.
