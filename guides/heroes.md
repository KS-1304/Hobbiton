# Hall of Heroes

The Hall of Heroes is a weekly event (Sunday to Tuesday) and is the only place to unlock Mythic heroes directly.

## Mechanics
*   **Mark of Valor**: You need 100 Marks to unlock a hero.
*   **Free Daily Mark**: Claim your one free mark from the shop every day of the event.
*   **Gem Purchase**: You can buy up to 99 additional marks using gems (150 gems each, total 14,550 gems). 
* **No Expiry**: Marks do not expire, but are specific to the current generation of heroes.

## Strategy
Once you unlock a Hero using Hall of Heros can can level it using normal Mythic Hero Shards, but Hall of Heros is still a good way to get Hero Shards.
