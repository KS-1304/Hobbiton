# Hall of Governors / Strongest Governor

Hall of Governors happens every 2 weeks during the first few months of the server.

The event then changes to Strongest Governor and happens once a month.

## Hall of Governors

The Hall of Governors is a 5-day event that runs every two weeks. It is the primary way for new servers to earn powerful hero shards.

Each time the event comes around, additional tasks are added.

Unlike Strongest Governor, you get points for completing tasks, not just for using speedups.

### Event Schedule

| Day | Focus | Best Tasks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | Construction | Complete Construction, Complete Research |
| **Day 2** | Heroes | Playing Hero Roulette, Using Hero Shards, Gathering Resources |
| **Day 3** | Troops | Training and Promoting troops |
| **Day 4 (1st)** | Beast Slay | Kill Beasts and Rally Terrors |
| **Day 4 (2nd/3rd)** | Gather Resources | Gather Resources, Complete Research |
| **Day 4 (4th/5th)** | Charms | Upgrade Governor Charms and Gather Resources |
| **Day 5** | Power Boost | Using Forgehammers, Hero Widgets, Completing Construction,  Research and Troop Training |
| **Day 6 (2nd+)** | Gov Gear | Upgrading Governor Gear |
| **Day 7 (3rd+)** | Final Push | Use any remaining hero shards, and using up any Construction, Research or Troop Training speedups. |

### Tips

You get points for 'completing' tasks, which means you can start the task on the days before.  For example starting to upgrade your town center a few days before, and then completing it on day 1 (using speedups if nessessary).

This also works for things like gathering resources, a few hours early, so it completes shortly after reset.  So you get an extra few hours of gathering.

## Strongest Governor

Once the server enters the "Age of True Gold" (usually around day 70), the Hall of Governors is replaced by the Strongest Governor event. This event lasts 7 days and features cross-kingdom rankings.

### Tips

*   **Hoard for the Event**: Save your Mithril, Forgehammers, and Hero Shards for the specific days to maximize your points.
*   **Tier Matters**: Points for troop training increase exponentially with the troop tier (T8 < T9 < T10). Always aim to promote to your highest available tier.
*   **Speedups**: You get points for using speedups, not completing tasks, so you can start tasks you can't complete in time.
