# Forsaken Temple

Forsaken Temple is a board-game style event where you use dice to navigate a map and upgrade tiles for massive resource gains.

## Core Mechanics
*   **Tile Leveling**: Every time you land on a tile, it gains experience. After 3 landings, it levels up (Grey -> Green -> Blue -> Purple -> Gold).
*   **Gold Tiles**: These offer the best rewards, including huge amounts of construction and research speedups.

## Strategy

### The Farming Phase
Use your **Common Dice** in the early days of the event specifically to level up tiles.
*   **Target Gold**: The goal is to get as many tiles to the Gold tier as possible. Once a board is heavily upgraded, the value of every roll increases significantly.

### Illusion (Golden) Dice
Save your **Illusion Dice** for precise landing. 
*   **Best Targets**: Use them to land on **Treasure Chests** or high-level **Gold Tiles** to maximize your loot.

### Shop Priorities
When spending Adventure Coins:
* Artisan Visions
* Governor Gear Materials
* Forgehammers
