When hosting a rally, all of your hero's expedition skills (the ones on the right) are used.

In addition to your hero skills, 4 skills are picked from the heros that join your rally.

For rally joiners, 4 players are picked to contribute one skill each, from their 'primary' hero.

That means the first hero sent by your rally joiners is the most important and contributes stats to the whole party.

## Attack Heros
