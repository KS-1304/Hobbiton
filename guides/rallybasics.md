# Rally Basics
When hosting a rally, all of your heroes' expedition skills (the ones on the right) are used.

In addition to your hero skills, 4 skills are picked from the heroes that join your rally.

For rally joiners, 4 players are picked to contribute one skill each, from their 'primary' hero.

That means the first hero sent by your rally joiners is the most important and contributes stats to the whole party.

Some hero skills activate some of the time.  We'll call those 'Chance Heroes'.  These can be very strong, but are best used as a rally host, not joiner.
