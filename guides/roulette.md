# Hero Roulette

The Hero Roulette is a 3-day event that typically starts on the second day of major milestones like [Strongest Governor (HOG)](./hog). It is your primary source for high-generation Mythic hero shards.

## How it Works
*   **Lucky Chips**: Each spin costs 1 Lucky Chip or 1,500 gems.
*   **Gem Discount**: Spinning in bundles of 10 costs 13,500 gems (save 10%).
*   **Free Spins**: You get one free spin daily.

## Strategy

Hero Roulette is a good way to spend gems as free or low spend player, Zoe in particular is a very good hero to go for, as she is a very strong infantry hero, for free or low spenders who don't have a good infantry hero yet.

### The 70 / 120 Spin Goal
The most efficient way to play is to save your gems until you have enough to hit the 70 or 120 spin milestone (approx. 90,000 or 157,500 gems). The last chests contain a lot of extra hero shards.

If you can't hit 70 or 120 spins, it's often better to skip and save for the next time that hero appears.
