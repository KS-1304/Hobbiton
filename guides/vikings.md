# Viking Vengeance Event

Viking Vengeance happens every two weeks, on Tuesday and Thursday. Players defend their alliance against up to 20 waves of Vikings.

The goal of the event is to rack up points by defending towns.

You get more points defending other towns than your own.

NOTE: Shields do not work during the Viking Vengeance event.

## Viking Waves

Wave 1–6: All Members  
Wave 7: Online Members  
Wave 8–9: All Members  
Wave 10: HQ  
Wave 11–13: All Members  
Wave 14: Online Members  
Wave 15–16: All Members  
Wave 17: Online Members  
Wave 18–19: All Members  
Wave 20: HQ  

## Strategy

To get the highest score you must remain online for the entirety of the event.  If you are offline, you and anyone defending your town will lose out on 3 waves of attacks.

To get the highest points, you should send out all of your troops to towns near to yours, ideally towns that players will be online during the event.

If you leave troops at home, they’ll fight the Vikings and steal kills from the players reinforcing you. That lowers their points.  If someone notices you have troops at home, they will likely remove their reinforcements to reinforce another player who follows the rules.

If you have more troops than you have capacity to send, you can leave Archers at home.  This will have an impact on the scoring, but it is better than leaving Infantry and Cavalry.

Use Bear Hunt joiner heroes when reinforcing other towns.

Make sure you leave your best defense heroes at home, and have your Guard Station configured.

## During the event

During the event, there will be an icon in the bottom right of the screen.

Here you will be able to see what wave the attack is on, battle reports of towns you are defending, and the 'members' screen, will show you the status of your allies.

During the early waves of attacks, you should check the reports of people who you are reinforcing, if you see a large number of kills by the owner of the town, it is best to move your forces to someone who has properly vacated their town.

From the 'members' screen you can see who is under reinforced, and redirect troops there to help out.  Be sure to always keep your town empty when a wave hits.

We ask that players don't Heal during the event.  If you do this, the troops are automatically added to your garrison and will steal points from players defending you.

If your town does fall to attack, don't worry, you still get points for defending others.  **Do NOT extinguish the fire** until after the event. It wastes resources and offers no strategic benefit. You can still reinforce others while your city is burning.

## HQ Attacks

After wave 9, 10 and 19 there is a larger gap between attacks to allow you to move troops.  After wave 9 and 19 you should protect the alliance HQ.

When the menu shows wave 10 as the next wave, check your battle reports until you see successful defense of wave 9, and then withdraw troops from a player close to you, and send a max of 50k troops towards the HQ.

The goal here is to fill the HQ with players, without reaching the squad cap.

After wave 10 is complete, be sure to withdraw your troops and return them to the player you were defending.

If there are more players online than slots in the HQ, you may need to only defend HQ on wave 10 or 20, not both.
