# Fishing Event

Before starting fishing, check the other pages, and make sure you collect all the free upgrades.

If you plan on buying any packs, do this first, as they increase the rewards you get, and you don't get these later.

Use your Ocean Prospectors and Fishing vouchers before normal casts, to level up as quickly as you can.

Once you've used your Prospectors, check the other pages again, you might have earned another.

Once you are out of Prospectors, only then use the normal casts.

## Upgrades

Upgrade your Line and Hook first.

## Casting

Try to keep to the side of the screen, only move out to dodge fish you otherwise would hit.

You should always use a lantern, you can buy extra with gems.

## Retry

If you mess up, you can pause and retreat, and try again for free.

## Which Fish?

If you use the ocean scanner upgrade, it will highlight the fish with the highest scores.  Try to memorize these so you can catch them when not using the scanner.

Pick up any mermaids caught in seaweed, these trigger a multiplier.

Chests are always worth the catch.

You can use the codex to work out which fish get the most points.
