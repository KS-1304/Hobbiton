## Stratergy

Players must be online during the event to take part.  Players who register but don't turn up, will affect matchmaking (result in stronger enemies).

Use Squad chat during the event to coordiate attacks/defence.

R4/R5 ca use lables or markers to direct players to targets.

At the beginning of the match, the strongest buildings are the Belltower and Royal Stables, so picking these first is useful.

Some players should focus on attacking/weakening the enemy to allow the defending team to focus on grabbing buildings.

Attacking players will need to take turns to allow troops to heal.

In the last 10 minutes of the game, focus on the Swordshrine using coordinated rallies.

Don't forget to activate any Buffs, or pet skills before starting the event.
