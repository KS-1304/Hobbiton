# Eternity's Reach

At the start of the match the most important thing to do is level up your skills.

### Skill Order
```
[  ] [✅]

```

Once you've researched the 3rd skill, you want to start triggering resources.

You do this by sending 1 march to gather resoures from mines, and then collecting the 3 nugets that appear.

Once the fracture Veins appear, focus on those until they are gone.

Don't forget to activate your gathering skill.
