# Eternity's Reach Event

This event runs twice a month.

You have to register for a timeslot, although you can switch to a later one if you miss it.

At the start of the match the most important thing to do is level up your skills.

### Skill Order
```
[  ] [✅]  
[  ] [✅]

```

Once you've researched the 3rd skill, you want to start triggering resources.

You do this by sending 1 march to gather resoures from mines, and then collecting the 3 nuggets that appear.

Once the fracture Veins appear, focus on those until they are gone.

Don't forget to activate your gathering skill, when sending troops out to gather.

If you're in an area with a lot of people around you, teleport somewhere more quiet.
