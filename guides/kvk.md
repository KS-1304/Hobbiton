## Battle Day

Players from both kingdoms can teleport to each other’s territory using Cross-Kingdom Teleporters.

You can attack players from the opposing kingdom.  You’ll earn points if their Town Center is within 3 levels of yours.

This phase lasts for 12 hours, from <span class="utc-time">10:00 UTC</span> to <span class="utc-time">22:00 UTC</span>.

The kingdom who did the best during the prep phase gets to attack the other kingdom's castle.

<span class="utc-time">10:00 UTC</span> - Cross Kingdom Opens  
<span class="utc-time">12:00 UTC</span> - Castle Battle

If an alliance from the same kingdom that holds the King’s Castle also captures the turrets, each turret gives a Lethality Bonus to the squads from that kingdom. The more turrets they control, the bigger the bonus:

1 turret: +8% Squad Lethality
2 turrets: +12% Squad Lethality
3 turrets: +15% Squad Lethality
4 turrets: +20% Squad Lethality

## Triage Phase

Troops that were completely lost (Lost in battle, that didn't go to your Infirmary or Enlistment Office) can be rescued.

Between Medical Satchels (bought using 550 gems), and Rescue Orders (gifted from alliance members) you can rescue up to 90% of your lost troops.

Each member of the alliance gets 20 rescue orders to give to other members.  Each order helps rescue 1% of the receiving players lost troops.
