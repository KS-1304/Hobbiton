# Joining a Bear Hunt Trap Rally

To cooperate with your alliance and to get a high score when joining Bear Rallies, you need to:
* Have the correct leading hero
* Have the right amount of troops
* Join multiple rallies

## Join Heroes

When joining a rally, only the first hero in the list is important.

The other hero slots can be filled with any hero, or left empty.

There are 4 main heroes to use when joining a rally:
* Chenko
* Yeonwoo
* Amane
* Amadeus

Ideally you should make sure that the top right skill on these heroes is as high as you can make it.

## Rally Size

When joining a rally, to help spread out troops and players, you should aim to not send more than 80k troops in a single rally.

At the beginning, you won't have enough troops to send out multiple rallies of 80k each, but as your troop number grows, you will be able to send out more full rallies, and also tweak ratios.

Some optimal ratios for bear are:
10% Infantry / 10% Cavalry / 80% Archers  
or  
10% Infantry / 20% Cavalry / 70% Archers  
or  
20% Infantry / 20% Cavalry / 60% Archers  

So to send out 3 full rallies with the optimal ratios you would need at least 144k archers.  If you don't have this amount, don't worry, just use whatever troops you have.  It's better to send full squads of 80k with the wrong ratio, than to leave troops at home.
