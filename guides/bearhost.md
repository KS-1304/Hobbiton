# Hosting a Bear Hunt Trap Rally

To host a rally for your alliance you should have the following:

* Be in the top 10 most powerful players online
* Be located within a few squares of the bear trap

Unlike when joining, you don't need specific heros to host a rally, but you should send your strongest, ideally ones with attack based skills, not defensive.

Remember however, to leave enough troops and appropriate heros to join other rallies.

## Rally Timing

To host a rally, the most important thing is to watch the timing.

It generally will not help the alliance to have 10 rallies all started at the same time.  Instead we want to stagger the rallies start times, so that when players troops return, they should find rallies with less than 2 minutes remaining.

Before the bear starts, you should coordinate with the players online to nominate a few people to go immediately, and other players to follow.

Depending on the number of hosts online, you might want to stagger rallies by 60, 90 or 120 seconds, to get good coverage.

If you have 9 rally hosts online, a good combo would be to have 3 players start rallies at:  
30:00  
28:20  
26:40
