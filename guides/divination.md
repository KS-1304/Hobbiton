# Mystic Divination

Mystic Divination is a 2 day, monthly card-flipping event where you can find major rewards like Forgehammers and Gear Materials.

## How to Play
1.  **Select Wish Reward**: Choose the high-value item you want to find most.
2.  **Flip Cards**: Each flip costs **Fortune Tokens** (earned from daily missions).
3.  **Cost Increase**: Each subsequent flip in a round costs significantly more tokens.

## Strategy

It takes up to 96 tokens to complete a board.  It is best to save tokens until you have enough to complete a board, rather than let the event end part way through.

Fortune Tokens do **not** expire. If you don't have enough to complete a high-value board, save them across multiple events until you have enough to reach the high-tier milestone rewards.

If you have saved up to complete a board, it is worth considering if the board is a good use of tokens.  Ideally you want a good multiplier, if you are going to invest lots of tokens.

You can see the items in the board at any time, so early in the game (after 4 flips), you can make a decision on wether to reset the board for one with more multipliers, or keep going with the current board.
